1 Top class for my program is queryParser.java in src.OperatorBuild  directory

2 In terms of the logic to achieve join condition, I make a joinExpressionVisitor that cuts all expression to two catagories, the one is SelectionExpression, the other is JoinExpression. Can when I build join tree structure, I put the selectionExpression first for slection Operator and joinExpression to join Operator.

3 there are some bugs in my code. 
First, I can not support SELECT S.A, S.C FROM Sailors S ORDER BY S.C, because I do not put schema to operator. I just set a common schema to get the attribute index for that schema.
Secondly, I can not support join more than two tabples. My program can just support joining two tables.
Thirdly, I did not put order by and distinct behind my join operator. Because of the schema design.

The data stores in samples/input/db/data/ subdirectory.
The schema stores stores in samples/input/db/schema.txt.
