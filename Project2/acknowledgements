I finished the project by myself without partner.

And teaching assistant Divyesh helps me a lot. I almost went to his office hour every week. So I would say thank you to him. Also I implement several ideas from discussion on office hour with Lucja. 

When debuging my program,  Stackflow helps me a lot.
